In order to eliminate the nastiness of dealing with the carousel in a big fat
monkey box, I'm going to bake some curry.
The Carousel is composed of a first entry, and a set of entries after that.
Each Carousel Entry is herein composed of a bit of form data. 
Each bit of form data needs it's own formatting based on the data involved.

So the plan is:
formEntry.jade == a mixin for dealing with a field of a form
carouselEntry.jade == a mixin for dealing with putting the fields into a page.
carouselHolder.jade == a mixin for dealing with the entire carousel//optional
